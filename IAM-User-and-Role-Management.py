#boto3.client() is a method provided by the Boto3 library (the AWS SDK for Python) that creates a client object for a specific AWS service. The client() method is used to interact with AWS services, allowing you to make API requests to the service. By passing "iam" to boto3.client(), you're specifying that you want to interact with IAM.

def create_iam_user(username):
    
    #def is a keyword used to define a function in Python. create_iam_user is the name of the function. username is a parameter of the function. It represents the input that the function requires when it is called. In this case, the function expects a string value to represent the IAM userâ€™s name. 
    
    response = iam.create_user(UserName="skaluskar")

    #iam.create_user(UserName=username) is a method call on the iam object, which is an instance of the Boto3 IAM client. UserName=username is a keyword argument that is passed to the create_user() function. The username variable holds the value of the name you want to assign to the new IAM user. response is a variable that stores the response object returned by the create_user() function.

    print(f"User {username} created successfully: {response}")

    #It is an example of an f-string (formatted string) in Python. An f-string is a feature introduced in Python 3.6 to embed expressions inside string literals. The syntax for an f-string is to prefix the string with the letter f and use curly braces {} to include expressions whose results will be evaluated and inserted into the string at runtime. {expression}: Any valid Python expression inside the curly braces is evaluated at runtime, and its value is inserted into the string.
